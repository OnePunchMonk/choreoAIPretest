## ChoreoAI Pretest


The project uses multimodal learning and point cloud data to generate dance choreography. By leveraging generative models, it aims to create expressive and dynamic dance movements that capture the essence of human creativity.

This project explores the intersection of AI and art, employing contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment and utilizing temporal transformers for motion prediction. It also integrates data visualization techniques to provide clear insights into the generated choreographic patterns. Through real-time feedback loops, it fosters collaboration between AI and dancers, enhancing the choreographic process.

It offers an innovative approach to understanding and generating dance, contributing to the growing field of AI-assisted artistic expression.
